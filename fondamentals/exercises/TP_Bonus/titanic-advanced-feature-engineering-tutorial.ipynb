    "I decided to write this kernel because **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is one of my favorite competitions on Kaggle. This is a beginner level kernel which focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Feature Engineering**. A lot of people start Kaggle with this competition and they get lost in extremely long tutorial kernels. This is a short kernel compared to the other ones. I hope this will be a good guide for starters and inspire them with new feature engineering ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is a great competition to apply domain knowledge for feature engineering, so I made a research and learned a lot about Titanic. There are many secrets to be revealed beneath the Titanic dataset. I tried to find out some of those secret factors that had affected the survival of passengers when the Titanic was sinking. I believe there are other features still waiting to be discovered. \n",
    "\n",
    "This kernel has **3** main sections; **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Feature Engineering** and **Model**, and it can achieve top **2%** (**0.83732**) public leaderboard score with a tuned Random Forest Classifier. It takes 60 seconds to run whole notebook. If you have any idea that might improve this kernel, please be sure to comment, or fork and experiment as you like. If you didn't understand any part, feel free to ask."

Those decks are mostly occupied by 1st class passengers. **M** has the lowest survival rate which is mostly occupied by 2nd and 3rd class passengers. To conclude, cabins used by 1st class passengers have higher survival rates than cabins used by 2nd and 3rd class passengers. In my opinion **M** (Missing `Cabin` values) has the lowest survival rate because they couldn't retrieve the cabin data of the victims. That's why I believe labeling that group as **M** is a reasonable way to handle the missing data. It is a unique group with shared characteristics. `Deck` feature has high-cardinality right now so some of the values are grouped with each other based on their similarities.\n",
